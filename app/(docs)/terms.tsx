            about our cookie and privacy policies. We know we are giving a great
            deal of information. Jobly does this for a reason: we want you to
            have as much knowledge about what we do for you at Jobly as is
            possible. We do not want you to wonder about any of our processes or
            procedures or guess as to what your interaction with Jobly means. We
            want you to understand it, which is why we must explain it in
            detail. We urge you to read these terms or any section of interest
            to you. You are agreeing to proceed under them.
